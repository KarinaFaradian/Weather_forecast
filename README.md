# Hi there!

### Welcome to Weather forecast APP.

I assume that hard workers always succeed so I`m glad to represent my first project made by using JavaScript, HTML, CSS.

I believe that you can easily use my Weather forecast APP because it`s convenient and clear for everyone.

##### In the next chapter I give you instruction in using Weather forecast APP.

You have an opportunity to select a necessary location by clicking on the blue button.

Then after clicking you can see a blue area where you need to input a city and subsequently press the button "OK".

As a result you will see the weather in the required city and a map with its location.

The advantage of the Weather forecast APP is that each visitor has clear perception of all of the APP`s functions.
